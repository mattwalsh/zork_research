YOU too can make BIG MONEY in the exciting field of PAPER SHUFFLING!

Mr. Anderson of Muddle, Mass. says: ""Before I took this course I was a lowly bit twiddler. Now with what I learned at GUE Tech I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best.""

Dr. Blank had this to say: ""Ten short days ago all I could look forward to was a dead-end job as a doctor. Now I have a promising future and make really big Zorkmids.""

GUE Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone. But when you earn your degree from GUE Tech, your future will be brighter."

FCD#3 was constructed in year 783 of the Great Underground Empire to harness the mighty Frigid River. This work was supported by a grant of 37 million zorkmids from your omnipotent local tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive. This impressive structure is composed of 370,000 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the center, and 193 feet wide at the top. The lake created behind the dam has a volume of 1.7 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.

The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to the dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree. The work was managed by a command team composed of 2345 bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type), 12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

We will now point out some of the more interesting features of FCD#3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities:

Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!

Unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning."

	.GSTR STR?158,"This is a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway turns into a southward path."
	.GSTR STR?124,"This is a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around."
	.GSTR STR?121,"This is a forest, with trees in all directions. To the east, there appears to be sunlight."
	.GSTR STR?166,"This is a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast."
	.GSTR STR?205,"This is a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft descending through the floor into darkness below. To the west and the north are exits from this room. Constructed over the top of the shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached."
	.GSTR STR?149,"This is a large room, whose east wall is solid granite. A number of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on the floor. There is an exit down a staircase."
	.GSTR STR?159,"This is a long and narrow corridor where a long north-south passageway briefly narrows even further."
	.GSTR STR?212,"This is a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken timbers. A wide passage comes from the east and turns at the west end of the room into a very narrow passageway. From the west comes a strong draft."
	.GSTR STR?148,"This is a long passage. To the west is one entrance. On the east there is an old wooden door, with a large opening in it (about cyclops sized)."
	.GSTR STR?162,"This is a narrow east-west passageway. There is a narrow stairway leading down at the north end of the room."
	.GSTR STR?215,"This is a nondescript part of a coal mine."
	.GSTR STR?130,"This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path."
	.GSTR STR?210,"This is a rather wide room. On one side is the bottom of a narrow wooden ladder. To the west and the south are passages leaving the room."
	.GSTR STR?172,"This is a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb. There is an ascending staircase to the west."
	.GSTR STR?196,"This is a sand-filled cave whose exit is to the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?216,"This is a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a coal mine. On the south wall of the chamber the letters ""Granite Wall"" are etched in the rock. To the east is a long passage, and there is a steep metal slide twisting downward. To the north is a small opening."
	.GSTR STR?214,"This is a small drafty room in which is the bottom of a long shaft. To the south is a passageway and to the east a very narrow passage. In the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain."
	.GSTR STR?207,"This is a small nondescript room. However, from the direction of a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected. To the south is a narrow tunnel."
	.GSTR STR?208,"This is a small room which smells strongly of coal gas. There is a short climb up some stairs and a narrow tunnel leading east."
	.GSTR STR?137,"This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls."
	.GSTR STR?157,"This is a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark, forbidding staircase leading down."
	.GSTR STR?156,"This is a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a staircase leading down."
	.GSTR STR?209,"This is a very small room. In the corner is a rickety wooden ladder, leading downward. It might be safe to descend. There is also a staircase leading upward."
	.GSTR STR?160,"This is a winding passage. It seems that there are only exits on the east and north."
	.GSTR STR?161,"This is an ancient room, long under water. There is an exit to the south and a staircase leading up."
	.GSTR STR?141,"This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste. The vandals left through either the north or west exits."
	.GSTR STR?143,"This is part of a maze of twisty little passages, all alike."
	.GSTR STR?145,"This is part of a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. A skeleton, probably the remains of a luckless adventurer, lies here."
	.GSTR STR?134,"This is the attic. The only exit is a stairway leading down."
	.GSTR STR?175,"This is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the prayer is a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to the north end of the room is through huge marble pillars."
	.GSTR STR?176,"This is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what appears to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads into darkness. You probably could not get back up it."
	.GSTR STR?179,"This is what appears to have been the maintenance room for Flood Control Dam #3. Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of the valuable equipment is gone. On the wall in front of you is a group of buttons colored blue, yellow, brown, and red. There are doorways to the west and south."
	.GSTR STR?178,"This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring the dam. There are open doorways here to the north and east marked ""Private"", and there is a path leading south over the top of the dam."
	.GSTR STR?244,"Too late for that."
	.GSTR STR?43,"Unfortunately, the magic boat doesn't provide protection from the rocks and boulders one meets at the bottom of waterfalls. Including this one."
	.GSTR STR?246,"up to your ankles."
	.GSTR STR?251,"up to your chest."
	.GSTR STR?249,"up to your hips."
	.GSTR STR?248,"up to your knees."
	.GSTR STR?252,"up to your neck."
	.GSTR STR?247,"up to your shin."
	.GSTR STR?250,"up to your waist."
	.GSTR STR?222,"Very good. Now you can go to the second grade."
	.GSTR STR?15,"Waving the "
	.GSTR STR?48,"Well, you really did it that time. Is suicide painless?"
	.GSTR STR?17,"Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of glue. As a result, your mouth gets glued together (with your nose) and you die of respiratory failure."
	.GSTR STR?242,"What a concept!"
	.GSTR STR?224,"Wheeeeeeeeee!!!!!"
	.GSTR STR?19,"With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry."
	.GSTR STR?50,"Wizard"
	.GSTR STR?180,"You are at the base of Flood Control Dam #3, which looms above you and to the north. The river Frigid is flowing by here. Along the river are the White Cliffs which seem to form giant walls stretching from north to south along the shores of the river as it winds its way downstream."
	.GSTR STR?202,"You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream. Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here."
	.GSTR STR?200,"You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable here. The lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by below. To the north is a narrow path."
	.GSTR STR?118,"You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees."
	.GSTR STR?120,"You are facing the south side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded."
	.GSTR STR?132,"You are in a small clearing in a well marked forest path that extends to the east and west."
	.GSTR STR?204,"You are in a small room. Strange squeaky sounds may be heard coming from the passage at the north end. You may also escape to the east."
	.GSTR STR?32,"You are lifted up by the rising river! You try to swim, but the currents are too strong. You come closer, closer to the awesome structure of Flood Control Dam #3. The dam beckons to you. The roar of the water nearly deafens you, but you remain conscious as you tumble over the dam toward your certain doom among the rocks at its base."
	.GSTR STR?195,"You are on a large sandy beach on the east shore of the river, which is flowing quickly by. A path runs beside the river to the south here, and a passage is partially buried in sand to the northeast."
	.GSTR STR?201,"You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon. You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a passage which it is impossible for you to enter. Below you is the canyon bottom. Above you is more cliff, which appears climbable."
	.GSTR STR?188,"You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the White Cliffs. There is a narrow path heading south along the Cliffs and a tight passage leading west into the cliffs themselves."
	.GSTR STR?190,"You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the Cliffs. A narrow path leads north along the shore."
	.GSTR STR?199,"You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River past the Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs. The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A rainbow crosses over the falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the southwest."
	.GSTR STR?139,"You are on the east edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen. A narrow passage goes north, and the path you are on continues to the east."
	.GSTR STR?194,"You are on the east shore of the river. The water here seems somewhat treacherous. A path travels from north to south here, the south end quickly turning around a sharp corner."
	.GSTR STR?181,"You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the Dam. The river flows quietly here. There is a landing on the west shore."
	.GSTR STR?154,"You are on the gently flowing stream. The upstream route is too narrow to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting walls. There is a narrow beach to land on."
	.GSTR STR?198,"You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the Falls. The rainbow travels east-west here."
	.GSTR STR?203,"You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal mine. The shaft enters the west wall, and there is another exit on the south end of the room."
	.GSTR STR?117,"You are standing in front of a massive barrow of stone. In the east face is a huge stone door which is open. You cannot see into the dark of the tomb."
	.GSTR STR?152,"You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream. The path follows the stream, which flows from west to east."
	.GSTR STR?269,"You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides."
	.GSTR STR?192,"You can land either to the east or the west."
	.GSTR STR?240,"You can't be serious."
	.GSTR STR?234,"You can't swim in the dungeon."
	.GSTR STR?131,"You cannot climb any higher."
	.GSTR STR?213,"You cannot fit through this passage with that load."
	.GSTR STR?173,"You cannot go down without fracturing many bones."
	.GSTR STR?182,"You cannot go upstream due to strong currents."
	.GSTR STR?174,"You cannot reach the rope."
	.GSTR STR?275,"You charge, but the "
	.GSTR STR?363,"You dodge as the thief comes in low."
	.GSTR STR?144,"You have come to a dead end in the maze."
	.GSTR STR?211,"You have come to a dead end in the mine."
	.GSTR STR?171,"You have entered a low cave with passages leading northwest and east."
	.GSTR STR?170,"You have entered the Land of the Living Dead. Thousands of lost souls can be heard weeping and moaning. In the corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous adventurers less fortunate than yourself. A passage exits to the north."
	.GSTR STR?260,"You have two choices: 1. Leave  2. Become dinner."
	.GSTR STR?177,"You haven't a prayer of getting the coffin down there."
	.GSTR STR?364,"You parry a lightning thrust, and the thief salutes you with a grim nod."
	.GSTR STR?387,"You parry a low thrust, and your "
	.GSTR STR?267,"You seem to be digging a hole here."
	.GSTR STR?219,"You should have looked before you leaped."
	.GSTR STR?42,"You splash around for a while, fighting the current, then you drown."
	.GSTR STR?351,"You stagger back under a hail of axe strokes."
	.GSTR STR?136,"You try to ascend the ramp, but it is impossible, and you slide back down."
	.GSTR STR?150,"You would drown."
	.GSTR STR?123,"You would need a machete to go further west."
	.GSTR STR?206,"You wouldn't fit and would die if you could."
	.GSTR STR?270,"Your "
	.GSTR STR?301,"Your stroke lands, but it was only the flat of the blade."
